The Experiment Factory, by way of its modular containers, has many good friends! Take a
look below at the different options you have for integrations.

 - [Surveys](/expfactory/integration-surveys) A survey integration is a simple plugin that uses Google Material Design Lite to administer form based surveys. Here we have prepared an automated builder to help you generate a survey folder.
 - [Robots](/expfactory/integration-robots): The Experiment factory robots are a set of scripts (and associated containers) that provide an automated means to run through experiments or surveys.
 - [LabJS](/expfactory/integration-labjs) LabJS is a beautifully done web interface for interactive experiment generation, and you can now export your experiments directly into folders ready for the Experiment Factory!
